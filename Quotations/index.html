        <p>A quote from goodreads website:</p>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com">
            I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am
            out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle
            me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.
